The dataset includes 320 images.
Map are annotated in YOLOv8 Oriented Object Detection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -15° to +15° horizontally and -15° to +15° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -20 and +20 percent
